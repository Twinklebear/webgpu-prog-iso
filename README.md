# WebGPU Speculative Progressive Isosurface Raycaster

This is the implementation of the GPU-parallel speculative, progressive
implicit isosurface raycasting algorithm for
block-compressed data sets described in "" by Will Usher, Landon Dyken, and Sidharth Kumar
at LDAV 2023. Please see the paper (link soon!) for more details.

## Usage
